### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

- [ ] i need to master these min ,max , clamp

- margin-trim doesn't supported yet

- display : block // is better for auto margin

- [ ] before and after work on blocks but it doesn't work on h1 i don't know why??

- don't put space before pseudo element or pseudo classes that cause a problem

- the wave images have height and width so when you say top maybe the empty area of the image will be there look to inspect
  with p we always have default margin

- when there are images need to change when the device's screen's size change those elements should be psuedo-elements
